# gmovie

We were able to create the full CRUD operations for post, get, get by id, patch, and custom method to manipulate the movie database.  The test was done successfully in Postman.
The unit test has an issue that may require hours of research because we saw others on the internet having the similar issue about repository not found.

## structure
This project was created with Spring Boot Initialzr by including JPA, H2, Spring Web, and other dependencies.
